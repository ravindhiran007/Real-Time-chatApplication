DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :

This project is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It enables multiple users to connect and exchange messages instantly without refreshing the page, showcasing the power of WebSockets for real-time communication. The application provides a simple yet effective interface where users can send and receive messages seamlessly, making it a great starting point for understanding event-driven web applications.

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, while Socket.IO handles the real-time bi-directional communication between the client and server. When a user sends a message, it is broadcast to all connected clients, ensuring that every participant sees updates instantly. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and responsive chat interface.

To run the application, users need to clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and start the Node.js server. Once running, the app can be accessed locally in the browser, where multiple users can join and chat in real time. The project is lightweight, scalable, and can serve as a foundation for building more advanced chat systems.

Future improvements can include features such as user authentication, private chat rooms, message persistence with a database, emoji and file sharing, and mobile-friendly UI enhancements. Overall, this project demonstrates the core concepts of real-time web communication using Socket.IO and serves as an excellent learning resource for developers exploring modern web application development
